# Week 1 – C

This week introduced the basics of the C programming language, including:

- Compiling and running code
- Using loops and conditionals
- Getting user input
- Validating input and formatting output

As I already have programming experience, I completed the "More Comfortable" versions of each assignment.

## Completed Assignments

### [Hello, World](./world/)
Basic program that prints `"hello, world"` — the classic first step to verify the environment is working.

### [Hello, It’s Me](./me/)
Prompts the user for their name and greets them using string formatting.

### [Mario (More Comfortable)](./mario-more/)
Generates a double half-pyramid of a given height using nested `for` loops and proper alignment.

### [Credit](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/psets/1/credit/) *(To be completed)*
Will implement Luhn’s Algorithm to validate credit card numbers and identify the card type.

## Notes

This week was a refresher on procedural programming with C. I practiced input validation, logic flow, and control structures while getting comfortable with CS50's development environment.
